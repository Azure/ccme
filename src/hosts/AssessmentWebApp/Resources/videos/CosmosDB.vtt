Azure Cosmos DB could be migrated by the DocumentDB Data Migration Tool

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The destination Azure Cosmos database and collection must be created manually

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
First we need to select the source as 'DocumentDB'

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Then we feed the connection string and collection name. Keep query empty for migrate all the data

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For the target, we feed the connection string and collection name too

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Skip advanced configuration. Check the import settings in the Summary page, then click 'Import'

00:00:41.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The Cosmos DB collection will be migrated to destination database

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.000
