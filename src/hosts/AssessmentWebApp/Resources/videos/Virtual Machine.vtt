Azure Virtual Machines could be migrated by Azure Site Recovery. First, let's build the ASR vault in target region

00:00:34.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Cross-region migration will be treated as physical machine migration. Select On-promises to Azure, no hypervisor for step prepare infrastructure

00:01:13.000 --> 00:03:37.000
And we need to create a virtual machine as the configuration server, in the same virtual network of source virtual machines

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Download the configuration installer and credentials for later use

00:03:42.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Setup static public IP for configuration server to ensure it could be reached by the ASR

00:04:13.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Let's innstall the configuration server

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Add manage account to configuration server. The account should be admin of source virtual machines

00:06:34.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Register the configuration server to ASR then setup the replication policy

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Remote connect to the source virtual machine. Apply registry to enable connection from configuration server

00:07:32.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Add source virtual machine to ASR as physical machine, then enable he replication

00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Once the replication was completed, we could verify it by test failover, or directly start the migration with "failover"

00:09:26.000 --> 00:10:17.000
The migrated virtual machine has no public IP by default. Let's assign a public IP manually

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Now the virtual machine is running in destination region. Let's check it via remote connection

00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:06.000
After the test failover completed, we could clean up the test virtual machine to save cost

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.000
