In this video, we are going to show how to migrate Blob storage via the AzCopy tool.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Before migration, we need to create a container in the destinaton Azure Storage Account

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Let's open a prompt window to enter the AzCopy command line

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Input the source blob container URL, storage key and "blob" as the source type

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Input the destinaton blob container URL, storage key and "blob" as the source type

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
At the last, we add a swith "/S" for recursive mode copy

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
By default, AzCopy will perform server-side asynchronous copy. Let's just wait until it was completed

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:16.000
From the Azure portal, we could verify if the blobs were migrated successfully

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.000
