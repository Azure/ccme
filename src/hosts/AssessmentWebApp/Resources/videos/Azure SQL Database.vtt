In this video, we are going to show how to migrate Azure SQL database from Global Azure to Azure China via SSIS

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Let's start the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard from SQL Server Management Studio

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Select the source Azure SQL server and database, using data source `Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server`

00:00:30.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Select the destination Azure SQL server and database, using the same data source `Microsoft OLE DB Provider for SQL Server`

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Select "Copy data from one or more tables or views"

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Then check all the tables for migration

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Let's run the migration immediately. You can also save the SSIS package for later use

00:01:13.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Just waiting for a moment, all the data will be migrated

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.000
