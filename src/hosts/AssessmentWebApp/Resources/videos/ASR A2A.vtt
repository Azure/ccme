In this video, we are going to show how to migrate Azure Virtual Machines between region via Azure Site Recovery

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
First, we need to prepare infrastructure for Azure to Azure migration

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Select source virtual machine then enable replication

00:00:42.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Once the replication was completed, we could verify it by test failover, or directly start the migration with "failover"

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Reminder, the migrated virtual machine has no public IP by default. We need to assign a public IP manually

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Now the virtual machine is running in destination region. Let's check it via remote connection

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
After the test failover completed, we could clean up the test virtual machine to save cost

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.000
