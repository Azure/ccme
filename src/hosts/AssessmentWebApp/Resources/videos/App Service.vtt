App Service could be migrated by the built-in feature backup/restore

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
First, we need to setup backup storage for the source App Service

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The backup storage could be any blob storage in the source region

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:46.000
For migration, there is no need to setup the backup schedule. Let's just trigger the backup manually

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Usually the backup job will be completed in minutes

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Before restore the backed App Service, we need to create an empty App Service in target region

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Then setup the backup storage with any blob storage

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Let's copy all the backup files from the source container to destination region. Then click "Restore"

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Select the restore resource as "Storage" since the backup were not generated the current App Service itself

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Select the zip file amoung backup files

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Select "Overwrite" to restore to the current App Service. We could also modify connection strings to point to the resource in the destination region

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Click "OK" then restore will be done in minutes. Let's check the migrated App Service

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.000
